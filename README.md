# Folder Stream

An interactive batch file that uses ffmpeg on Windows to perform rtmps streaming of files with a specified extension in a folder.

Tested on Telegram PC (Windows11 21H2, 4.8.10 x64) live stream. **Very good audio quality** compared to in-app streaming. 

## Usage Example

1. Make sure you installed ``ffmpeg`` on your Windows machine and added it to PATH. Check by running fffmpeg in a ``cmd.exe`` console. You may get something like this:
